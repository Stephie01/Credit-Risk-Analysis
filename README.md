# Credit Risk Analysis
## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning model for credit risk assessment, enabling accurate and efficient classification of individuals as good or bad credit risks. This model aims to enhance the credit evaluation process used by financial institutions, providing a more reliable and data-driven approach to lending decisions.

## Problem Statement

The problem at hand revolves around the challenge of assessing an individual's creditworthiness accurately. Traditional methods of credit assessment might overlook complex relationships within the dataset, leading to suboptimal lending decisions. This project aims to leverage machine learning to create a predictive model that considers various attributes to classify credit risks effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 1000 records of loan data, where each entry represents a person seeking credit. The dataset includes both numerical and transformed categorical features, with the response variable indicating whether an individual has defaulted by failing to repay a loan installment for more than 90 days.

## Data Understanding

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset underwent preprocessing to handle missing values and transform categorical variables into numerical features. This step ensures the dataset's quality and compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring relationships between attributes was crucial to identify key factors contributing to credit risk. EDA provided insights into the dataset's characteristics and potential patterns.

3. **Model Building:** Machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier, were developed to predict credit risk. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This assessment provided a comprehensive understanding of how well the model can classify credit risks.

5. **Comparison of Models:** A comparison was made between different machine learning algorithms to select the most suitable one for accurate credit risk assessment.

By addressing these steps, this project aims to provide financial institutions with an effective and reliable credit risk assessment model. This model will aid in making informed lending decisions, reducing the potential for defaults, and ensuring responsible lending practices.
